= RushCheck library - a random test library for ruby

RushCheck library is a random test tool/library for ruby where
almost features are imported from QuickCheck library in Haskell.
QuickCheck has been developed by Koen Claessen and John Hughes in 2000.
  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/
Because programs can be written functionally in ruby, like Haskell,
the implementation of RushCheck is quite similar to QuickCheck.

Check also directories data/rushcheck/doc and rdoc for details.

= LICENSE
This package has two different files for license issue.
One is the Expat/MIT license and another is the LGPL license.

RushCheck is distributed under the Expat/MIT license.

The author wish that RushCheck should be distributed under the same
license of QuickCheck, however I've never seen the license of
QuickCheck. I choose the Expat/MIT license because the license
Expat/MIT is similar to ghc's and is compatible with the GNU GPL.  
I don't know whether the license of ghc is compatible or
not. (possibly yes) 

This package includes 'setup.rb' for installation. The setup.rb
is distributed under LGPL. Because the RushCheck library does
not use any output of setup.rb and not linked to setup.rb,
the LGPL is applied to setup.rb only. (Let me know if I am
misunderstanding about the license issue)

= Changes from setup.rb ver 3.4.1

The installer setup.rb is distributed under LGPL by Minero Aoki.
  http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/setup/
  http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/setup/

There are two changes from the original setup.rb ver 3.4.1.

1. change for the test command of setup.rb

I have to modify setup.rb to work with darcs. Darcs requires
the test script that it should be change the status to 1 when
any test is failed. However, the original setup.rb (ver 3.4.1)
does not change unless a test is failed.

2. add the rdoc command to setup.rb and distclean the rdoc dir
